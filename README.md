It forecasts the outcome depending on the patient's state, including low, medium, and high ECG, temperature, pressure, and patient ID information. Here, the outcome is shown using Five Modules. 

Gathering Datasets: The characteristics of the temperature, pressure, eCG, and patient ID datasets are gathered in the form of CSV files with the aid of IOT.

Preprocessing Datasets: It is employed to process data into the system's appropriate format. 

Data Visualisation: Here, we make use of concepts from exploratory data analysis (EDA), such as kernel distribution plot, histogram plot, bar chart, and data. 

Model Implementation: To train and forecast the system's outcome, we employ a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, naive bayes, decision trees, and support vector machines. 

Classification and Prediction: All of the algorithm's machine learning model accuracy scores are displayed, followed by performance metrics such as the precision, recall, f1 score, and support classification reports. A confusion matrix and a comparison graph of the various machine learning algorithm scores are also displayed. Lastly, the user is provided with input data in the form of an array, and the final prediction displays the user's condition (low, medium, and high).
